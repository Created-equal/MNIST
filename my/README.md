These solutions are based on neural networks.

I got these ideas from [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html). I am really grateful to the author Michael Nielsen.

The code is written for Python 3.8.

The result.png shows an accuracy of $97.89\%$, which is achieved by neural_network_5.py. It is not an outstanding result because the number of training epochs is not big enough.
